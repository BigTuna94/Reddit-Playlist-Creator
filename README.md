# Reddit-Playlist-Creator


Simple script to create a Google Play Music Playlist based on a music subreddit.

This was written based around common post formating from /r/metalcore.

Everything currently works, but there is some setup involved. Please see PRAW's online documentation for getting everything setup. The Google Play music setup is more intuitive.
